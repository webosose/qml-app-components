Step 1
Copy everything in this dir to target machine home, and run it.
ex) scp -r ./* root@IPADDR:~/
ex) eos-benchmark-launcher ~/main.qml
Expected result: red bg screen with beanbird image with dummy text, and rect on left top, right top with #FF00FF color(like purple)
                 It can be closed soon. (Not important)
Note : Testing local customization file override with component/object loader.

Step 2.
Remove customization dir in TARGET machine, and run it
ex) ~# rm -rf ./customization
ex) eos-benchmark-launcher ~/main.qml
Expected result: blue bg screen with "B" large text image. rectangle on left, right top with green color.
                 It can be closed soon. (Not important)
Note : Testing common fallback when only system common style exists.

Step 3.
Remove every customization file in TARGET machine, and run it
ex) (IN TARGET MACHINE) ~# rm ./style.json; rm ./*.png; rm ./CustomizedCommonModule.qml;
ex) eos-benchmark-launcher ~/main.qml
Expedted result: white bg screen with beanbird image, and a rectangle-shaped line on left-top and right-top.
                 It can be closed soon.
Note : Testing no-style fallback
