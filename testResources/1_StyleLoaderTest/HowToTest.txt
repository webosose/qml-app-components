Step 1
Copy main.qml to target machine home dir and run it.
ex) scp ./main.qml root@IPADDR:~/
ex) eos-benchmark-launcher ~/main.qml
Expected result: gray bg screen with beanbird image that located in center. It can be closed soon. (Not important)
Note : Testing default fallback when no style exists.

Step 2.
Copy style.qml and one png image to target machine home dir and run it.
ex) scp ./style.qml root@IPADDR:~/
ex) scp ./default.png root@IPADDR:~/
ex) eos-benchmark-launcher ~/main.qml
Expected result: blue bg screen with "B" large text image. It can be closed soon. (Not important)
Note : Testing common fallback when only system common style exists.

Step 3.
Make customization dir in target home dir, and copy some file to it, and run it.
ex) (IN TARGET MACHINE) ~# mkdir customization
ex) scp ./customization/style.json root@IPADDR:~/customization/
ex) scp ./test.png root@IPADDR:~/
ex) eos-benchmark-launcher ~/main.qml
Expedted result: red bg screen with beanbird image WITH green dummy text. It can be closed soon.
Note : Testing local style file override
